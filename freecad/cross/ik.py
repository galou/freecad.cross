    """Return some solutions to the inverse kinematics of a Robot.

    Compute the joint positions to reach the given target.
    Some algorithms may return multiple solutions.

    For search-based algorithms, a seed configuration must be provided.
    The optional arguments `max_iter`, `transl_tol` and `rot_tol` are used to
    tune the search in this case.

    Return a list of solutions, each solution being a list of joint values.

    Args:
        - robot: The Robot to compute the inverse kinematics for.
        - from_link: The name of the link to start from.
        - to_link: The name of the link to reach.
        - target: The target placement of `to_link` relative to `from_link`.
        - seed: An optional seed configuration to start the search from.
                The number of values must match the number of joints from
                `to_link` to `from_link`, including fixed ones.
        - fixed_joints: An optional dictionary of joint names to fix with their
                value.
                This argument is mandatory for closed-form algorithms for robots
                with more joints than the degree of freedom of their end-effector.
        - max_iter: The maximum number of iterations to perform.
        - transl_tol: The translational tolerance to consider the target reached.
        - rot_tol: The rotational tolerance to consider the target reached.
